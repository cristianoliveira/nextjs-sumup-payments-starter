# Welcome to Buy me a coffee by SumUp

This project is mostly a proof of concept on how to use the SumUp online payment
ecosystem to start receiving payments online.

## Getting started

First, configure the app by creating a `.env` based on the `.env.example` [file](https://github.com/cristianoliveira/nextjs-sumup-payments-starter/blob/main/.env.example) with your configurations:

```
cp .env.example .env
```

Once edited the configuration, run the development server:

```bash
yarn && yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
